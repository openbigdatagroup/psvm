This is an all-kernel-support version of SVM, which can parallel run on multiple machines.\r\n\r\nWe migrate it from Google's large scale computing infrastructure to MPI, then every one can use and run it. Please notice this open source project is a 20% project (we do it in part time), and it is still in a Beta version. :)\r\n\r\nIf you wish to publish any work based on psvm, please cite our paper as:\r\nEdward Chang, Kaihua Zhu, Hao Wang, Hongjie Bai, Jian Li, Zhihuan Qiu, and Hang Cui, PSVM: Parallelizing Support Vector Machines on Distributed Computers.
